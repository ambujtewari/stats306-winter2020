The health `status` of individuals in our simulation can only be one of three values: `\"H\"` (for healthy), `\"I\"` (for infected), and `\"R\"` (for recovered). In the beginning, a set of size `initial_size` is chosen at random without replacement from among the $n$ individuals. These individuals are marked as `\"I\"` (i.e., infected).\n",

It is initially set as follows: for each individual assign `compliant` to `TRUE` with probability `c_rate` (we will play with different values of `c_rate`). In our simulation, compliant individuals do not move at all at any point in the simulation (but they can still get infected if an infected, non-compliant individual comes into contact with them). \n",
